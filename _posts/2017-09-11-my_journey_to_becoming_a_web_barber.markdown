I've always been heavily involved with technology. 

Throughout the years, my dad's professional life has been predominantly filled with positions in the Technology Realm. Growing up, I remember him working for Cisco for 10+ years. He has held a few positions before and in between, including being the CEO of a small startup. Currently he is one step short of a Director at Mozilla. His life has definitely had a huge impact on my knowledge of technology. Hearing his stories developed this innate desire to want to experience and be exposed to any kind of technology in whatever way possible.

My ability to understand devices, and ideas of how technology worked started at a young age because of him. I remember disassembling electronics, intrigued by certain connections and being so interested in finding out how everything was working. I would look up tutorials on how to make gadgets and cool 'toys' with old household electronics including burning lasers from old DVD burners or Projectors made out of those old Ghetto Overhead Projectors we are all so familiar with from our high school days. It seemed to just be apart of me. 

Rewind 10+ years from today and you'll find me sitting in a computer lab at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia - at around 12 years old. I had been selected to be apart of what they called back then, a GATE(Gifted and Talented Education) program. This was a program designed for the fair few in our grade who seemed to excel in certain areas. We linked up with the others selected by their individual schools and were thrown together in a 3 day mini-course at the local Uni. I forgot exactly everything that was taught, but there is one thing that has never left my side. 

Adobe Photoshop.

We all sat around a classroom with a computer in front of us. The teacher told us to open Adobe Photoshop Elements. I had never even heard of this program before as my 12 year old self. I remember the splash screen as it began to load, and I was so excited the learn something new. We were taught a few things and then handed DSLR Cameras. We had to go get a few photos of ourselves in weird positions. We soon returned to the classroom ready to go with our photos. We fired up Photoshop again and began to start messing around. I remember manipulating myself to fit into a small styrofoam cup. It was here where it all began. I now had a tool so powerful in front of me, that I could create literally anything imaginably possible. 

The course ended and I found myself trying to download illegal copies of the program just so that I could get another taste of the program. After school, I would watch tutorials to teach myself, and within a few short months I had mastered photoshop. I soon began to tackle the Adobe Creative Suite, and since then things have never been the same.

Once I had tackled the Adobe Suite, I stumbled across tutorials on how to make websites. I began messing around and following along and soon found myself with a small 'Hello World' printed across my Internet Explorer browser. I was hooked. HTML was now my goto. High School began and I found myself stuck and limited by certain restrictions on our computers as I sat in my high school computer class. Those afternoons then turned from Photoshop Tutorials into CMD tutorials and figuring out ways how to 'hack' through certain restrictions on the computers. I remember learning how to create little batch files that would open thousands of command prompts and essentially fork bomb the computer until it crashed. I would then place them on my friends computers, change the name and icon to Internet Explorer and sit back as my friends would unknowingly walk into what I thought was the best prank ever.

I soon found myself in the principle's office time and time again for pranking my fellow classmates or sneaking past blocking software with proxies - One time making 18+ people late to school by logging into my schools roll through their server and unknowingly shooting late slips out the printer in the front office.

Amidst the middle of this, my family and I moved to the Silicon Valley. I was now in the heart of it all.  The desire began to grow and I continued to learn more and more. I got heavily involved in sports and became pretty well rounded. I took a few AP Classes in High School including AP Computer Science and 2D Design, allowing me to feed both beasts at the same time. I continued to better myself in both designing and coding. I then graduated, and attended Brigham Young University for a few years. I studied Computer Science for some time, before switching majors to Graphic Design. I was now sure I was wanting to pursue something with a little of both.

I am now pursuing both of these subjects as a Designer and a Developer - or as I like to say, as a Web Barber.

I have seen hundreds of websites lacking in both functionality and design and it is my goal to change that. A bad haircut is pretty bad, but a bad looking website is even worse.

Thank You Flatiron.
