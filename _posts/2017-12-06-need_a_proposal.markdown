I've always struggled with the idea of pitching my services to clients. No matter what I've tried I always seem to get stuck on the same few little details each and every time. 

- What are you going to do for me?
- What is the next step from here?
- Can we get a contract signed?
- How much do your charge?

Blah blah blah blah blah.... So repetitive every time. 

...and not to mention the countless number of hours needed to create those proposals.

I decided to create something to change that. 

For my Rails final project, I put together all these pain points to create a program that generates proposals for you as a freelancer - for your clients.

Here is what it entails.

A Freelancer(You) comes to the site, creates an account and logs in. They click the 'New Proposal' button and then are presented with all the fields related to this project.

These fields include a Proposal Title, Email for the client, Budget, Milestones, Checkboxes for whether or not the Invoice has been paid, and a few other features.

The coolest part however, is when a New Proposal is created, a New User is created simultaneously and emailed their login details - with a default password of 'Password123'. 

You can now link the client to your site, where they can log in with those details and wait for it...

CLICK TO SIGN YOUR PROPOSAL.

The E-Signature validates the Users Email and Password to provide maximum security.

Once a client has signed the proposal, the proposal can no longer be edited, but lies as the means of agreement between the two parties.

I can't wait to use it on my next client. 

If you're interested in checking it out. I'll have a link to my Heroku Published app sooner then later - but this one will more than likely be produced and available for the world to use.

PS.... I have some tips on What Not To Do..


Never leave your Email Authentication Settings on your GitHub Account.

I made that mistake and am still dealing with the effects of a hacked email account.

Oh well you live and you learn.
