Something about Amazon really intrigues me.

Before starting my latest project, I was extremely obsessed with Amazon, and so I decided to base my project on that obsession I had. I decided I was going to build a tool that would allow the average user - either buyer or seller, to access the best selling items on the platform.

Beginning the OO chapter and section, I had a hard time really understanding how all the individual parts of Object Orientation really worked together. I slowly began to grasp the idea, and now I am at the point where I can say I really understand how it all works.

My Amazon Tool, is made up of a few individual objects comprised together to create a bigger monster. I have an Item class, a Category Class, and my Products class which overlooks the other two classes. These Objects interact together providing each other with the information needed for the program to work.

The program goes like this. 

A user views the menu, and chooses one of the top 6 categories available on the Amazon Best Sellers page.

After selecting the category, a user then sees the top 3 best sellers of that category.

At first they will see name & price, and then if wanted, a user can select to see more info on the product.

Upon that selection, a user will not have access to the star rating, a clickable product url, in addition to the name and price.

The concept of the program is very simple in the fact that it eliminates the need to have to visit the Amazon website in order to find the bestsellers.

In the future I'll be adding many more features, including a review generator, which I have almost completed.

I thoroughly enjoyed the project, and am looking forward to adding more as I continue to learn and experiment with OO & the CLI. It would be awesome if I could turn my app into one containing a GUI rather than a CLI.

Maybe in the near future.
