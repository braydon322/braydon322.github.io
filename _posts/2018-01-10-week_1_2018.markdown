2018 has already been a good year for me. I hit my first goal of increasing my weekly income and tripled the amount I previously had been earning week by week. I pulled in $1200 all from home - that is, with Web Design, Logo Design and my Graphic Design services.

I am approaching the end of this course and it is extremely hard for me to decide how exactly I want to approach this 'job' thing. Do I want to stick to what I'm doing and hopefully succeed through the depths of Freelancing, or do I want to suck it up and go and work a 9-5. I don't know.... quite frankly I don't want to do the latter.

My Wife and I have this goal of visiting every country in the world. By working a 9-5 there's no way I can hit that goal ever. Yes the money may be there, but I am stuck and controlled by a schedule, boss, and crappy hour long drives home through Silicon Valley traffic. That is not what I'm wanting.

Right now, I'm thinking I'm going to stick with freelancing. I ready to do my own thing and truly excel with the skills I have developed over the past few years. I can spend more time with my wife and son, go see the world, and make money all at the same time. That is my goal for 2018. To develop something strong enough to be able to pay me the money I want from anywhere in the world.

Hold me to it world.

I'll be touching back in next year on how it went.
