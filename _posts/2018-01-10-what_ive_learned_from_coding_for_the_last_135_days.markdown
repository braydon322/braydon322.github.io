Wow, feels pretty good saying that. 

Scrolling through github seeing 300+ commits really makes you wonder how you got to where you are today. Around 4 months ago I began this journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. There have been both good and bad times but the things I have learned will forever change me - and I'm not just talking about the code I have learned.

Learning to code and develop is a huge obstacle. It requires a whole new way of thinking. 4 months ago, I wanted nothing but to design and start my own design firm - I knew very little code apart from basic html & css. Now I sit on the complete opposite side of the spectrum as I commit daily to github and rollout little projects hour by hour. It's been an amazing experience.

Just last week I was scrolling through instagram, and came across an ad for a software that boosts your follower count. I looked into it a little more and tried to figure out exactly what it did. Essentially, It followed a bunch of users within a specific niche, with hopes of them following back. The more you follow, the more followers you'd receive. It would also try and mimic a natural human commenting on other peoples posts to encourage them to develop somewhat of a relationship with you and your account based on the comments. I looked at the pricing and they were offering a free 14 day trial, then would charge something like $30/monthly. It got me thinking...

20 minutes later I had whipped up a Headless Selenium Script that could log into my instagram account and do the exact same thing that they were charging for. 20 minutes later....... I realized then just how valuable the things I've learned are. The next morning I had gained 100+ followers and by day 2 I had hit 150, just from running my simple program for 5 minutes.

I love being able to create whatever I want, whenever I want it. It's an amazing feeling knowing that I could possibly have that next big thing.

Thank you Flatiron.

I'm forever indebted.
