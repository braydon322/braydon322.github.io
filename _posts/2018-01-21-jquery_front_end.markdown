I've got 4 days until I get hit with the next big payment for Flatiron.

With that in mind, I have a goal. I need to finish the full-stack program by that day.

Today, I woke up and began working on my Rails-jQuery final project, and I'm happy to say I've just completed it.

I'm some 75 lessons away from completing - with now one final project left. 

This is doable. 

Ok, Now back to this jQuery project.

I loved this assignment. There was something I absolutely hated about the last project I checked off, and now since having gone through this most recent section, I've pin pointed exactly what it is that I hate - a lack of good solid UX/UI. That's all due to the fact of the locked up browser whenever buttons were clicked. It was great going back through my code, refactoring, and even better than that, making this project pleasant for users. I enjoy things like that.
Being a designer at heart, there is nothing more important to me than the aesthetics. Now I'm happy.

The JS - Rails section has been a very enjoyable one for me. Beginning the program I remember having a lot of trouble using Javascript and Ruby. It's been really cool and rewarding seeing just how well I have developed these skills through the help of Flatiron. I can now code for hours and hours on end, with a knowledge of what I'm doing(and when I don't, I can actually understand StackOverflow). I really can't express how great of a job Flatiron does with this program. I'm seriously considering going through other programs with them.

Well, this one was kind of just a ramble, but life's good. My code is getting better, and the end is near.. Very near.... 3 days away near.
