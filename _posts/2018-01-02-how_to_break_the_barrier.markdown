I don't know what it is but for years now I've had this inability to communicate with technical individuals. I'm talking engineers, programmers, or what the world would pin as 'nerds'. 

The most ironic thing though, is that I'm writing up a blog post for myself, for my tech blog, for a school which is comprised 100% of these same technical minded individuals.

I love technology. However, I feel that I'm different. 

Growing up, I had this insane desire to want to teach myself any and everything when it came to computers and technology. I would spend hours reading over articles on the web, or watching youtube videos explaining different ideas and concepts that were so new to me. 

From the age of 10 I taught myself anything and everything that I've ever wanted to know. I started with the Adobe Creative Suite and it blossomed for there. I remember editing pictures of friends and family morphing from animals - the same exact images we see everywhere across the web. I taught myself how to code - specifically how to build little viruses to prank my friends. I'd learn how to turn their volume up and text-to-speech some ridiculous innapropriate sentence that would be sure to get them in a pickle wherever they were. I remember hacking through firewalls and servers and using keyloggers to steal my friends Social Media logins just so that at the perfect moment I could sneak in and attack from the inside out. I loved doing things like that. 

However, the thing that really stuck with me has been this inate desire and ability to just design. That's it. The code fell off, the hacking fell off, and the pranks definitely stopped. As I look back I realize how strongly the design aspect always stuck to me. 

I think this is where it all came into play. I excelled in Math and Science usually placing in the top of my class... but what was crazier was that in Art and Design classes I'd place in the top of the class one grade above me. I began to chase it and I really began to struggle with communicating with those who weren't 'Design Oriented' but were more Logical or Analytical thinkers. It soon became tough. 

I attended college and declared myself as a Computer Science major. However a few months in I went back to my bread and butter - design. It was all for one reason. I couldn't communicate with the people. I didn't connect with the professor, I didn't connect with peers, and I couldn't stand the guy in the corner continually asking if he could use his raspberry pi instead of a laptop to complete his projects. 

I love you my fellow techies, but for those of you who also encounter this struggle or predicament, here are my tips.
I'll keep it short.

# 1. Find the commonalities.
I'm a firm believer that I've only made it this far by learning to hone in on an individuals personality traits that are similar to yours. How do they respond to this? How do they act when I say this? What does their body language tell me?
As you hone into these, you'll be MUCH more successful in carrying out these conversations.

# 2. Keep it Simple.
If you're not technical, don't try and fake it. They will DESTROY you. Do not act like you know everything when you don't. It will have adverse affects than what you were thinking. Hone into the commonalities and focus on enphasizing those points.

# 3. Use your Strengths.
Everyone is good at one thing or another. If you're not good at something you just haven't looked deep enough. Recognize your strengths and be humble.


Something about the designer in me flipped this switch. Don't be one of the Techies that people don't like talking to. Don't be weird. Don't forget to shower or trim your hair every so often, and for goodness sake, cut back on that Dr.Pepper. 

Be you and focus on the 3 steps I gave you and your convos should get 100x better. Before you know it you'll be enrolled in a coding bootcamp now loving the people you once struggled to communicate with. 

Focus on the little things and you'll make it.
